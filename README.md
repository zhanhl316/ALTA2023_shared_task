[Homepage](https://www.alta.asn.au/events/sharedtask2023/description.html)

# Basic Task Description
The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a paradigm shift in the field of human-computer interactions. However, akin to any groundbreaking technology, LLMs are a double-edged sword for our society. Beyond disseminating distorted news, the potential misappropriation of LLMs may engender a myriad of social and ethical dilemmas, including academic malfeasance and election manipulation. This incident underscores the escalating urgency within scholarly communities to devise strategies for the detection and thorough scrutiny of synthetic text.
